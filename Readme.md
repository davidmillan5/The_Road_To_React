# The Road to React: Your journey to master plain yet pragmatic React.js

**What you will learn.**

In "The Road to React" you will learn about all the fundamentals of React.js with Hooks while building a full-blown React application step by step. While you create the React application, every chapter will introduce you to a new React key feature. However, there is more than only the fundamentals: The book dives into related topics (e.g. React with TypeScript, Testing, Performance Optimizations) and advanced feature implementations like client- and server-side searching. At the end of the book, you will have a fully working deployed React application.

**Is it up to date?**

Programming books are usually outdated soon after their release, but since this book is self- published, I can update it as needed whenever a new version of something related to this book gets released.

**I am a beginner. Is this book for me?**

Yes. The book starts from zero and takes you through the learning experience step by step. Every chapter builds up on the learnings from the previous chapter. In addition, at the end of every chapter, exercises fortify your lessons learned. If you got stuck in a chapter, you will always find a reference URL to the status quo of the actual code.

**Core Concepts**

Pragmatic: Master React while building a complete application step by step.
Problems Solving: You need to experience a problem first before solving it.
The Why: Readers like how the book answers the Why, not only the How.
